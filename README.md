    Contribution -

Start an issue for whatever feature you believe should be good here.

And, in case you want to be a contributer here, and work on it together, do ask.

Do sugggest any other feature you would like, i do claim the codebase to be quite modular, and easily customisable.
Future Plans -

Currently, I am learning more of the 'web thing' ;D, and I have completed ALL i wanted in this initially, so lesser chance i will work much on it, but as i say, if you ask of something in it, I do consider.

    Creating a web version of this, probably using Angular
    Have an API endpoint, that connects the web version, the cli version, and the GUI. (API basically done, will be customised, when i go for the web version)
